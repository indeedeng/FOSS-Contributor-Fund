## Introducing FOSS Contributor Fund

_Indeed’s program for financially supporting free and open source software (FOSS)._<br><br>

FOSS Contributor Fund is a program framework that organizations can use to subsidize FOSS projects. It puts sponsorship decisions in the hands of employees who are active in the open source community. We created this framework to encourage open source participation and help companies take an active role in sustaining projects.



## Why does Indeed do this?

### Why support open source software projects?

Most of the web wouldn’t work without the open source community. Indeed’s own core technology sits atop thousands of open source dependencies, which are in turn developed and maintained by tens of thousands of developers. Many of these dependencies are developed as volunteer efforts without strong corporate sponsorship or financial backing. It’s important for Indeed and other companies to financially support the people and organizations who design, build, and maintain open source software. By contributing both money and time to these projects, we help ensure that these projects are developed sustainably.

### Why let employees choose recipients?

By democratizing the sponsorship process for employees, we give current open source participants the ability to select projects for funding and help the community grow by incentivizing contribution.



## How a fund works

A FOSS Contributor Fund runs for one year. At the beginning of the year, you define the total amount that your organization will donate to open source projects. At Indeed, we run the fund quarterly, awarding three grants per quarter. The elected project receives 1/12th of the year’s total fund. Anyone in the organization who makes an open source contribution in the month leading up to the election can vote.

### Project nominations and eligibility

Anyone in your organization can nominate a project. Projects must meet these requirements to be eligible:

* **Your organization (or one of its subsidiaries) must use the project.** <br>
By requiring that projects are in use, you can ensure that donations align with business interests.

* **The project must use a [license approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) by the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org/).** <br>
Because the goal of OSI is to support the developers of free and open source software, an approved license is essential. Other options include:
  * Licenses endorsed by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html)
  * Licenses that meet the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses)
  * Licenses on the [Fedora Software License List](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing)

* **The project must have some mechanism for receiving funds.** <br>
These are some examples of funding methods:
  * [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
  * [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)
  * [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)
  * [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors)
  * An umbrella foundation, such as [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)

* **The owner of the project can’t be an employee of your organization (or any of its subsidiaries).**<br>
This helps prevent legal, ethical, or financial complications.

### Who can vote?
Anyone who makes an open source contribution can vote for a project as long as the contribution is within the same calendar month.

We recommend using [Starfish](https://github.com/indeedeng/starfish), our open source tool that identifies eligible voters. Starfish bases voter eligibility on pull requests, issues, and comments. 

Code and documentation aren’t the only ways employees can contribute to open source projects. For example, they might organize a meetup or volunteer at an event. We recommend that you give voting privileges to these uncounted contributors. 

### How do I collect and count votes?
We recommend a transparent voting process. There are many internet voting tools, such as integrated Slack polls and [DirectPoll](http://directpoll.com/).
